**HackerSim** is an interactive, browser-based game that drops you into a retro hacking terminal. You'll take on the role of a hacker, running network scans, infiltrating secure systems, reading files, and completing a series of story-driven missions.

The entire game is a self-contained single-page application built with **React** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**. It features a persistent game state that saves your progress, a leveling and XP system, and dynamic visual elements drawn with the HTML Canvas API.
